# stores-cheshire-cat-ai-documentation
this tool allows you to add all the documentation to the cat's memory

# activation
to activate just tell the cat **'update documentation'**, the process will take a few minutes, you will get the warnings as it loads the documentation pages

# feature:
the program not **only allows you to add all the documentation** of the cat but also allows you to **update it** since every time it eliminates the old documentation by re-memorizing it

the process can take several minutes to complete, __I advise you not to interrupt it especially if you are updating since you risk losing some data__
