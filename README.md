# stores-cheshire-cat-ai-documentation
this tool allows you to add all the documentation to the cat's memory

# activation
to activate just tell the cat **'update documentation'**, the process will take a few minutes, you will get the warnings as it loads the documentation pages

# ATTENTION:
the process only needs to be **done once**,
since otherwise the process will duplicate the data creating an exact copy in memory
